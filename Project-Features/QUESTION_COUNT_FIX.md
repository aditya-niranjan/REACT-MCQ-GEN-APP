# 🔧 Fixed: Question Count Issue

## Problem
User requested 20 questions but only received 10 MCQs.

## Root Cause
The AI (Gemini) was not strictly following the instruction to generate the exact number of questions requested. The prompt was not emphatic enough.

## Solution Applied ✅

### 1. **Enhanced Prompt** 
Made the prompt much more forceful and explicit:
- Added "CRITICAL RULES" section
- Repeated the exact count multiple times
- Used emphatic language (EXACTLY, MUST, NO MORE NO LESS)
- Added counting instruction: "1, 2, 3... ${numQuestions}"

### 2. **Increased Token Limit**
Added generation configuration:
```javascript
generationConfig: {
  temperature: 0.7,
  topK: 40,
  topP: 0.95,
  maxOutputTokens: 8192  // Increased for more questions
}
```

### 3. **Added Verification Logging**
Now the backend logs:
- ✅ Requested count
- ✅ Actual count generated
- ⚠️ Warning if counts don't match

### 4. **Question Counter**
Backend now counts how many questions AI actually generated and logs warnings if mismatch.

## Updated Files ✅
- `backend/services/geminiService.js` - Enhanced prompt + logging
- Backend server restarted with fixes

## How to Test

### 1. Make sure backend is running:
```powershell
# Should see:
🚀 Server is running on http://localhost:5000
```

### 2. Start frontend:
```powershell
cd d:\MCQ-GENERATOR\frontend
npm start
```

### 3. Test with different counts:
- Try 5 questions
- Try 15 questions
- Try 20 questions ⭐
- Try 30 questions
- Try 50 questions (maximum)

### 4. Check backend logs:
You'll now see:
```
📥 Received request to generate MCQs
📊 Requested count: 20
✅ Final question count to generate: 20
🔄 Sending request to Gemini API for 20 questions...
✅ Successfully generated MCQs from Gemini API
📊 Requested: 20, Actual: 20
```

## New Prompt Structure

The new prompt is much more explicit:

```
You are an expert MCQ generator. Generate EXACTLY 20 Multiple Choice Questions...

CRITICAL RULES:
1. Generate EXACTLY 20 questions - NO MORE, NO LESS
2. Number them Q1, Q2, Q3... up to Q20
3. Each question MUST have exactly 4 options: A), B), C), D)
...

IMPORTANT: You MUST generate all 20 questions. Count carefully: 1, 2, 3... 20.
```

## Expected Behavior Now

✅ Request 20 → Get 20 questions  
✅ Request 5 → Get 5 questions  
✅ Request 50 → Get 50 questions  
✅ Logs show exact counts for verification  
✅ Warning if AI doesn't comply  

## Status: ✅ FIXED

Backend has been restarted with the improvements. Try uploading your PDF again with 20 questions!
