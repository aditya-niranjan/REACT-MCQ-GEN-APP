# ✅ FIXED - MCQ Generator Now Working!

## Problem Solved ✨

The error was caused by using an outdated Gemini model name. Your API key was **valid** all along!

### What Was Wrong:
- Code was trying to use `gemini-pro` (old model)
- Your API key supports `gemini-2.5-flash` (new model)

### What I Fixed:
✅ Updated to use `gemini-2.5-flash` model  
✅ Upgraded to latest `@google/generative-ai` package (v0.24.1)  
✅ Added better error handling and logging  
✅ Created verification scripts
